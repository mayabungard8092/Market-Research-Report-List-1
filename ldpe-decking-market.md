<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The LDPE Decking Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Capped composite</li><li>Uncapped composite</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The LDPE decking market is primarily divided into two types: capped composite and uncapped composite. Capped composite decking features a waterproof polymer shell that protects it from moisture, staining, and fading, offering enhanced durability and low maintenance. In contrast, uncapped composite decking lacks this protective layer, making it more susceptible to environmental wear but usually at a lower cost. Both types leverage low-density polyethylene (LDPE) for flexibility and resilience, catering to different consumer preferences and budgets in outdoor decking solutions.</p></p>
