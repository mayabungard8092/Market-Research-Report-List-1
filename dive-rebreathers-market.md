<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dive Rebreathers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed Circuit Dive Rebreathers</li><li>Semi-Closed Dive Rebreathers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dive rebreathers market is primarily categorized into two types: closed circuit and semi-closed circuit rebreathers. Closed circuit rebreathers recycle exhaled gas, removing carbon dioxide and adding oxygen, allowing for extended underwater durations with minimal bubbles, ideal for deep diving and stealth operations. In contrast, semi-closed circuit rebreathers expel a portion of the gas, mixing it with fresh oxygen, providing simpler design and less complexity, often used for recreational diving. Both types enhance underwater efficiency and safety.</p></p>
