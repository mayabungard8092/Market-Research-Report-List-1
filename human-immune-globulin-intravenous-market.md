<p><strong>The Human Immune Globulin Intravenous Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Immunodeficiency</li><li>Autoimmune Disease</li><li>Acute Infection</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Human Immune Globulin Intravenous (IVIG) market primarily serves three key applications: immunodeficiency, autoimmune diseases, and acute infections. In immunodeficiency, IVIG provides essential antibodies to bolster the immune response in patients with weakened defenses. For autoimmune diseases, it helps modulate the immune system, reducing harmful responses against the body's own tissues. In cases of acute infections, IVIG offers passive immunity, aiding in the rapid defense against pathogens. Together, these applications highlight IVIG's critical role in diverse therapeutic areas.</p></p>
